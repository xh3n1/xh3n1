The c-base is the crashed spacestation in the center of Berlin. Nerds, Geeks, SciFi-Fans and digital activists founded the society in 1995. Since that time they reconstruct the space station and use it to share knowledge, interact with other species and provide a space for likeminded groups and individuals. Some people say, that the c-base is “the mother of all hackerspaces”, okay, maybe we will believe that.

I visited C-base together with some friends from Open Labs Hackerspace ( The brightest hackerspace). It was one of the best things I did during my stay in Berlin this summer. Hopefully, I will visit it again in the future.
